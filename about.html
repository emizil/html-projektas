            <h2>Pirmas puslapis</h2>
            <p> I see trees of green
                Red roses too
                I see them bloom
                For me and you
                And I think to myself
                What a wonderful world</p>
            <h3> Antrasis puslapis</h3>
            <p> I see skies of blue
                And clouds of white
                The bright blessed day
                The dark sacred night
                And I think to myself
                What a wonderful world</p>
            <h4> Treƒçiasis puslapis</h4>
            <p>The colors of the rainbow
                So pretty in the sky
                Are also on the faces
                Of people going by
                I see friends shaking hands
                Saying, "How do you do?"
                They're really saying
                "I love you" </p>
            <h5> Ketvirtasis puslapis</h5>
            <p> I hear babies cry
                I watch them grow
                They'll learn much more
                Than I'll never know
                And I think to myself
                What a wonderful world</p>
